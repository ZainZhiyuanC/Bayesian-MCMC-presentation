# Bayesian-MCMC-presentation
介绍了MCMC在计算贝叶斯估计中的应用，有MCMC和贝叶斯估计的简单的理论推导，计算公式和以两个混杂的泊松分布为例的模拟结果。模拟中使用了带MH算法的Gibbs算法，带舍选抽样法的Gibbs算法，和自己新提出，适应本例但没有验证过泛化性的Hybrid-MCMC方法，比较了他们计算的速度和估计的精度。

The application of MCMC to computational Bayesian estimation is presented, with a theoretical derivation of both MCMC and Bayesian estimation, computational formulas and simulation results based on a hodgepodge distribution of two different Poisson distributions. The simulations use Gibbs' algorithm with MH algorithm, Gibbs' algorithm with Rejection Sampling Method, and my self-proposed Hybrid-MCMC method, which adapts to this example but without verified generalizability, comparing the speed of their computation and the accuracy of their estimation.
